Simple little math quiz - thought about this with aging parents as a fun little game to keep them fresh. 

Since I like to play around, I went to the wayback machine and used jquery for this! It was fun to remember how the heck to do that. Also used very early chatgpt model to do some of the frontend styling... which I had to pretty much completely redo. :)

http://mathquiz.ericmuntz.dev should work to play with it.
